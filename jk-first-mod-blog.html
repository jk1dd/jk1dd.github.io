        <h2>Module 1 Reflections</h2>
        <p>8 March 2017</p>
        <p>Even several days into Intermission week, I still canâ€™t believe Module 1 is over. I have rarely learned so much in such short a time - the only comparable situation in my adult life is when I was learning the Ukrainian language for my Peace Corps service. But that was only 4 hours of class a day, and no homework or projects! In that case, I ended up functional in just 12 weeks of language training and immersion, which served to keep me safe and integrated in my community for the next 2 years. I am excited to see how far I can go with my longer education at Turing!</p>
        <p>I am energized to keep learning, and excited for Module 2. Coming at this with no experience, I struggled with occasional crises of confidence - with so many roller coasters, I sometimes feel like I am at some sort of terrifying theme park. I know there are still gaps in my knowledge (to say nothing of those gaps of which I am not yet aware). However, that is a big part of what attracted me to the tech field - there is always something new to learn and a new challenge to face. I aim to continue to develop my own grit in tackling new, complex things with a growth mindset.</p>
        <p>Technology-wise, I was blown away by learning to use a text editor. I had no idea how powerful they were until I started using one every day - and I am still constantly learning new shortcuts and about new packages to improve my speed and workflow, and output more solid work. I currently use Atom, which I feel fairly comfortable with, but I would like to learn to get off the mouse and stay on the home keys even more.</p>
