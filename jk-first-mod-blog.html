      <p>First module done - how fast did it go! It was a challenging experience, though very rewarding. It was quite a shift moving into such a fast-paced program - at times I felt like I was on a roller coaster. Getting into the rhythm of Turing has had its challenges - along with large amounts of new material every day, it took time to get used to new people in a new place.<br>
        I enjoyed learning to use a text editor - Atom is my current choice. It seems like every day, I learn some new tip or feature to make my workflow faster, or help me connect some other dots with other things I am learning. There are so many shortcuts to move around the page, and so many built-in and community-produced packages to help one along.
